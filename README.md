# Speaking
Slides for talks I've done. Feel free to take a look at the slides! I usually do TED talk style talks - I don't add much content on my slides, instead I use them to help remember the story I'd like to tell.

Some these were talks at my former workplace, Mercatus. I been ran a lunch and learn series to help my company become more data driven.
